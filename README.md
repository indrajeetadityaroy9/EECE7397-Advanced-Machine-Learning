# EECE7397 Advanced Machine Learning

Graduate-level coursework on probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference, spanning graphical models, latent variable methods, and nonparametric Bayesian techniques. Topics include multivariate Gaussian identities and least-squares/regularized regression, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes, approximate inference (variational methods and Bayesian uncertainty estimation), and modern deep generative modeling (VAEs, normalizing flows, GANs, and denoising diffusion probabilistic models).
